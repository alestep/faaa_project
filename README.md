## Project summary:
We will create an app which will feature charades in a competitive environment. This software is loosely based on concepts, such as DrawSomething, Quizkampen, Ruzzle and other competitive, social games on mobile devices. We have the goal to release this application sometime in the near future, although it still require some work in order to be finished.

## Acknoledgements:
We have used the services of Parse.com for the duration of this application development. This has worked like a charm, and have reduced the amount of work required in order to implement this application.
